# Codeforce porblem picker
<h2>Diclmair</h2>
<p>I deveolped this program as a way to help the community I take the most pirde of being part of ACM chapter Shoubra.</p>
</p>The whole idea was to automate the process of choosing codeforces problems for online contests held for the chapter members.
  However anyone is welcomed to use/edit it the way he/she sees fit.
  Till now it's still in development but this is a simple running version for how I hope this thing turn into. <h5>All suggestions opinions and offers of help are most welcomed</5> 
<h2>To run...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You're gonna need python 3.6+ installed.</li>
  <li>install the tkinter library -usually gets installed automaticly with python-</li>
  <li> navigate to the program folder and run <h5>python gui.py</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Fatures so far</h2>
  <li>update the base to the lateset codeforces problems with a push of a button</li>
  <li>Add the handles of participants</li>
  <li>Choose the tags you want</li>
  <li>specify how the tags are filtered</li>
  <li>problems gets saved to 'problems.txt'</li>
  <li>Also the ability to launch the last used handles and /or tags</li>
  </ul>
